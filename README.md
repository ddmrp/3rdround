# 3rdround

Round 3 Take Home -
 
Choose a fortune 500 website of your choosing. Your choice should reflect a website that has non-trivial user interaction requirements such as:
路         You have to log in
路         You have a user profile settings page
路         There are UI elements that require the user to engage
路         Some of these UI elements should initiate dynamic JavaScript actions (not just following anchor links)
 
Create Test Plan
 
Your plan should detail the core functionality of the website, and have at least 5 core user stories. Each user story should have at minimum 2 test cases that require automation.
 
Create a web automation test suite that can be run against the site by us. Your deliverables should include comprehensive instructions as to how to run the suite (As well as the test plan, and suite itself).
 
Extra Credit: Additional user stories, test cases. For the suite, hook it into any of the free CI tools online to run the suite and report results.
